#Problem 8
# For this problem you are going to simulate growth of fox and rabbit population in a forest!

# The following facts are true about the fox and rabbit population:

# The maximum population of rabbits is determined by the amount of vegetation in the forest, which is relatively stable.

# There are never fewer than 10 rabbits; the maximum population of rabbits is 1000.

# For each rabbit during each time step, a new rabbit will be born with a probability of prabbit reproduction

# prabbit reproduction=1.0âˆ’current rabbit populationmax rabbit population

# In other words, when the current population is near the maximum, the probability of giving birth is very low, and when 
# the current population is small, the probability of giving birth is very high.

# The population of foxes is constrained by number of rabbits.

# There are never fewer than 10 foxes.

# At each time step, after the rabbits have finished reproducing, a fox will try to hunt a rabbit with success rate of pfox eats rabbit

# pfox eats rabbit=current rabbit populationmax rabbit population
# In other words, the more rabbits, the more likely a fox will eat one.

# If a fox succeeds in hunting, it will decrease the number of rabbits by 1 immediately. Remember that the population of rabbits is never lower than 10.

# Additionally, if a fox succeeds in hunting, then it has a 1/3 probability of giving birth in the current time-step.

# If a fox fails in hunting then it has a 10 percent chance of dying in the current time-step.

# If the starting population is below 10 then you should do nothing. You should not increase the population nor set the population to 10. 
# Start with 500 rabbits and 30 foxes.

# At the end of each time step, record the number of foxes and rabbits.

# Run the simulation for 200 time steps, and then plot the population of rabbits and the population of foxes as a function of time step. 
# (You do not need to paste your code for plotting for Part A of this problem).

# Use the following steps, and the template file rabbits.py (click to download .py file), as guides in your implementation of this simulation.

# Step 1: Write the procedure, rabbitGrowth, that updates the number of rabbits during the first part of a time step

# Step 2: Write the procedure, foxGrowth, that updates the number of rabbits and foxes during the second part of a time step

# Step 3: Write the master procedure, runSimulation, that loops for some amount of time steps, doing the first part and then the second part of 
# the simulation. Record the two populations in two different lists, and return those lists.
